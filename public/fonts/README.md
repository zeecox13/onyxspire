# Catchy Mager Font Files

To use the Catchy Mager font on this website, please add the following font files to this directory:

- `CatchyMager-Regular.woff2` (or `.woff`)
- `CatchyMager-Bold.woff2` (or `.woff`)

## How to get the font files:

1. **From Canva**: If you're using Canva, you can download the font files if you have access to them. Note that Canva fonts may have licensing restrictions for web use.

2. **Purchase the font**: Catch Mager (also known as "Catchy Mager") is available for purchase from:
   - MyFonts: https://www.myfonts.com/collections/catchy-mager-font-sensatype-studio/
   - Sensatype Studio: https://sensatype.com/product/catchy-mager-fancy-ligature-font

3. **Convert existing font files**: If you have the font in `.ttf` or `.otf` format, you can convert them to `.woff2` and `.woff` using online converters or tools like `woff2_compress`.

## Important Notes:

- Make sure you have the proper license for web use of this font
- The font files should be named exactly as shown above for the CSS to work
- `.woff2` format is preferred for better compression, but `.woff` will work as a fallback
- The font will automatically fall back to 'Playfair Display' if the files are not found
